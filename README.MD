# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of simple linear regression in Python. The notebook is intended for educational purposes, showcasing the basic principles of linear regression and how it can be applied to data analysis.

## Overview

Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. In this notebook, we:

- Explore the concept of simple linear regression.
- Load and visualize the data.
- Implement the linear regression model using Python libraries.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Visualize the regression line along with the data points.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tools including linear regression.

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
